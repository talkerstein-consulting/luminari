/**
 * The Talkerstein coin, spinning over the credit line while it is hovered.
 *
 * One glb (the light cut, under a megabyte), one canvas the size of the
 * coin, mounted only once the plaque is first hovered and torn down when
 * the pointer leaves, so the footer ships nothing for it until someone
 * asks. It is fixed to the middle of the screen at most of its height
 * (see .tcg-coin). The coin turns about its vertical axis, a full turn in about three
 * seconds, and the whole thing fades in and out with CSS on the wrapper
 * (see .tcg-coin in tcg-badge.css); this component only spins.
 *
 * The model is a 40mm disc lying in the XY plane, so it is already facing
 * the camera; the camera is set close enough that the coin fills the box
 * with a little air. The environment is three rectangles of light, the
 * same kind the turntable uses, because silver reads as silver only with
 * something to reflect; a preset would fetch an HDR from a CDN.
