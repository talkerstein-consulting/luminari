 * The credit line, with the Talkerstein coin over it on hover.

 * At rest: the glyph as a mask painted in `currentColor`, inside a link,
 * and nothing else. Hovered: the lettering goes gold, and the coin fades
 * in over the middle of the line, spinning, for as long as the pointer
 * stays. Leave, and it fades out and unmounts.
 *
 * The plaque's hit area is padded well past the lettering (see
 * .tcg-plaque in the CSS): a 16:1 strip of 10px capitals is not a target
 * anyone can land on a phone, and the padding is what makes it one.
 *
 * On a touch screen there is no hover, so the first tap shows the coin
 * for a beat and then follows the link; a second tap follows it at once.
